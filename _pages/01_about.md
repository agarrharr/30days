This is my personal blog covering my 30 Days of Code experiment. Right now I'm focusing on honing my HTML and CSS skills, but I might move into ot
her areas if I'm having fun. I hope you find this project as interesting as I do!

I'm not a total beginner. I have  C++ experience from my college days and know my way around a linux terminal. I've also done web-dev stuff in the
 past, but I always felt like a bit of a charlatan in the front-end realm. Hopefully I can change that!
