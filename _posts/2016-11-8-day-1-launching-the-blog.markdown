This is the first day of my 30 Days of Code project. For the next month I'll be deep-diving into HTML5, CSS3, and Jekyll! I've worked with each technology in the past, but I've always felt like a bit of an imposter. I'll be starting with fairly basic tutorials and then building up to more sophisticated projects. My goal is to fill in any knowledge gaps as well as fine-tune my skills along the way. 

For the first project, I built this blog. I sort of cheated, because I followed Tania Rascia's excellent tutorial [Make a Static Website With Jekyll](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/). I highly recommend it to anybody who is interested in building a site in Jekyll.
