Today I'm going to be diving into the Mozilla Developer Network and their guide to [CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout). 


== Introduction to CSS Layout == 


We can overried the normal layout flow using the following techniques:
- The position property.
    - static is the default in normal flow, but you cause elements to be laid out differently by using other values.
- Floats.
    - Applying a float value such as left can cause block level elements to line up next to eachother instead of on top of eachother.
- The display property. 
    - Standard values such as block, inline, or inline-block can change how elements behave in normal flow. 
    - Specialised values allow us to lay out elements in completely different ways using tools like flexbox.

**Floats** 

- Allow elements to float to the left or right, rather than on top of eachother.
- Main use it to lay out columns and float text around an image. 
- The float property has four possible values:
    - left: floats elements to the left.
    - right: floats elements to the right.
    - none: default value with no floating at all.
    - inherit: the value of the float should be inherited from the parent element.
